##First Graph 
We usually use ggplot function to draw plots, it has several components as the following:
1- data: Here we specify the dataFrame that we'll use 
2- mapping: Here you specify the x-axis and y-axis 
3- Add drawing component
4- Add lables to the graph
5- Faceting (having different graphs based on different values of a specific variable)
```{r}
ggplot(data=mn_homes, mapping=aes(x=area, y=salesprice)) + geom_point()
```
As we see above, geom_point() represents each record in the dataframe
with a point in the plot. It usually helps to detect outliers.There are different types of drawing. For example, we can use geom_smooth()
to represent the relation between two variables with a curved 1ine as you can see below:

```{r}
ggplot(data=mn_homes, mapping=aes(x=area, y=salesprice)) + geom_smooth() + geom_point()
```
As we see that we're able to combine two function of geom() to see the graph

##aes()
aes() method also allows us to change some visual properties in the plot including: shape, color, size, and transparency, for example, we can change the color of the points in the plot based on another variable (such as fireplace, beds, baths)
```{r}
ggplot(data=mn_homes, mapping=aes(x=area, y=salesprice, color=beds, shape=fireplace)) + geom_point()
```
We can also add lables to the graph using the labs() methods as the following: 
```{r}
ggplot(data=mn_homes, mapping=aes(x=area, y=salesprice, color=fireplace)) +geom_point() + labs(title="sales price VS area of homes in Minneapolis, MN", x="Area (square feet)", y="Sales Price (dollars)")
```

```{r}
ggplot(data=mn_homes, mapping=aes(x=area, y=salesprice, color=lotsize, size=fireplace)) + geom_point() + labs(title="sales price VS area of homes in Minneapolis, MN", x="Area (square feet)", y="Sales Price (dollars)")
```

##Faceting 
We can also have different graphs based on different values of a
specific variable. For example, if we want make a similar graph to what
we have above but for each community (community is a variable in our
dataFrame), we can do the following:
```{r}
ggplot(data=mn_homes, mapping=aes(x=area, y=salesprice, color=fireplace)) + geom_point() + labs(title="Sales price VS area of homes in Minneapolis, MN", x="Area (square feet)", y="Sales Price (dollars)") + facet_wrap(~community, nrow=2)
```



## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
